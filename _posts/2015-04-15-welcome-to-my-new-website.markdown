This is my first blog post!. I am very excited for this blog, so much so that a few exclamation marks cannot communicate the excitement, so here are a few emoticons :-D :-D :-P.

So, coming back to the point of this article, which is to give a nice direction to this blog and mark a milestone for me.
In the near future this blog will be focused mostly on Technical stuff like, playing with new frameworks, providing how-tos for fellow learners and just generally writing about life of a programmer which revolves around these technologies.

As a geek I try out new things quite often, so most of the time I loose track of what I have previously tested and played with. So, Hopefully this blog will be like a book keeping tool for all the technologies I have played with in the past and a constant reminder to try out something new and keep things nice and interesting for someone who might accidentally stumble upon this website :-).


PS:- As you can see from the structure of the post that I am a newbie at writing posts, so please bear with me :-). I intend to learn as I write more posts.
