    <h2 class="section-heading">Software</h2>
</div>

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). Simply one of the best text-editors out there.
- [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) is my preferred flavour of Linux.
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) VCS. Great tool for managing content. A potential lifesaver for content creators.
- [i3wm](http://i3wm.org/), Tiling window manager. Light weight, Fast and simple.
- [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/) configuration. Better than Bash.
- [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) mail client. Quick to access from the terminal and I can choose my own editor for writing mail.
- When I "have" to use Windows, I fall back to [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) with [Muttator](http://www.vimperator.org/muttator/).
- [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) IRC chat client with plugins for XMPP.
- [Vifm](http://vifm.info/) file manager. Vim key bindings <3
- [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) for HTML/CSS/JS.

All of the configuration files for the above mentioned tools are available at my [dotfiles](http://github.com/shubham1337/dotfiles) repository.
