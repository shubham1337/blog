        A fully responsive, Cross-browser compatible website. Hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and generated using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Icons used in this website are all SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), for sharp and clean look, Agnostic of the screen they are viewed in (Even the triangles in the banner background are all SVG). My Development toolset for this website was as follows: <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, for building the website and watching for file changes, which eases the development cycle, <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>, Package manager for the front-end which aided in quick experimentation of some new packages, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> for managing CSS better.

        A Massively Open Online Course Platform being developed at IIT Kanpur. It has been used to run online courses such as <a href="http://arch4cloud.in/">Architecture for Cloud</a> and <a href="http://mooconmooc.org/">Mooc on Mooc</a> which had a worldwide audience and massive number of registrations, Currently it is being used by IITK to conduct a series of MOOCs in the field of Agriculture named <a href="http://agmoocs.in/">agMoocs</a>. It was my privilege to be working with the diligent team at IITK. The team consisted of 4 developers, from which 2 worked at the back-end (which is written in NodeJS) and 2 (including me) at the front-end (EmberJS). Technologies that I had to tackle with on a day to day basis were: EmberJS, Handlebars, Socket.IO, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and many more javascript libraries. It was a phenomenal experience for me and my first project which is being used by thousands of students to learn and grow.
